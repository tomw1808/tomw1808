# 2025 - More Blockchains, Markdown, Education and tools

It's May 2025 and the year is in full swing. I was so busy that I didn't find the time to update this brief overview, but that's changing right now. So what have we achieved so far?

A long standing issue of my learning platform ethereum-blockchain-developer.com was that its built on MkDocs-Material. It's awesome, but static. I am long time contemplating migrating it to nextjs, but its about 300 pages with very distinct syntax and features. That's why I started building a drop-in replacement in Nextjs: https://mkdocs-shadcn.org - However, at the end I decided to semi-abandon this project for nextra4. I am therefore focusing my efforts into making nextra4 a breeze to use including a [migration drop-in replacement script](https://www.mkdocs-shadcn.org/blog/20250420)

I am very busy working on a new kind of Stablecoin that balances algorithmic on-chain properties and hard off-chain promises. More on that a bit later.

We moved Morpher from our proprietary plasma sidechain to Base. Quite an undertaking.

In honor of the old Truffle Dashboard I sat down one weekend and coded an [alternative Foundry-Dashboard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/foundry-dashboard) that even decodes the transactions based on the ABI from the Foundry Build-Artifacts.

# 2024 - RAG+LLMs, Account Abstraction, (Swing) Trading
I started toying around with RAG+LLMs. My Masters Thesis included a lot of text processing, which comes in handy. I am currently playing with Jan.ai, Nitro and many more or less off-the-shelf products to summarize daily news to get actionale bullet points. 

I am also trying to get into Swing Trading. I always did trade based on fundamental news, but never tried to get entries and exits right. Currently reading Bob Volman -  Understanding Price Action.

I also finally read up on ERC4337 - Account Abstraction and made a [litte video](https://youtu.be/v_V4Wqcn7vE) about it. 

# 2023 - CloudFormation, NextJS
2023 was a big year for me. I finally got to fully learn Infrastructure as Code. The Morpher Infrastructure is now fully coded in yml files. 

Furthermore, I was trying to use Cloudformation in a special way: Building preview environments that clone production: RDS, ECS, Codepipelines with multi-arch builds, Fargate/Spot with EC2 in the mix, and many more. I am a big fan of Vercels previews. I am actively trying to bring them into my workflow with AWS CodePipeline and ECS.

I also started to use NextJS, Tailwind and Framer-Motion. I like those animations a lot.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, I'm always happy to help.
